![3 years working at Plataformatec](/assets/threeyearsworkingatplataformatec.png)

Hello, folks! This month is my third anniversary working at Plataformatec. For all these years working there, I've learned a lot about programming and software development process. The good part after all these years is the company still offer a broad menu of challenges and knowledge for improving my skills. The best part is the Plataformatec team is amazing, the people there is very welcoming and inspiring. I just not have coworkers, I have friends.

Two years ago I wrote ["1 year working at Plataformatec,"](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2014/05/1-year-working-at-plataformatec/){:target="blank"} I recommend you to read if you want to know a little bit more about Plataformatec, things that have impressed me, and stuff that I have learned.
