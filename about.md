say something about me, what do you want to know? What I do for surviving
in this post apocalyptic world? Well, I help teammates and customers
achieve sustainable software development. Why? Because it helps deliver
awesome software to end users and also they pay money to me. One of my
tasks to help with it is writing and reviewing a lot of code, that's why they
entitled me with the honorable title: "Software Developer". It's not just my
title of course, my other teammates has the same title. That's why we need to
use our birth names to communicate with each other. Imagine the confusion would be if we use the job title, "Hey Software Developer, I need your help.", everyone will question "Are you talking with me?". When they want to talk to me they use my name and my name is Ulisses.

Ulisses with "i"? Where is the "y"? Is not Ulysses? WHY? HA! I'm from Brazil, here in my country we use Ulisses. OH "In Spanish is Ulises". I've mentioned that I'm software developer
right? Well I work at [Plataformatec](http://www.plataformatec.com.br), there
we do a lot of web development with Ruby and Elixir.

Work, work, code, work, code, work, bah so boring, where is my hobbies? I really would like to impress you, you did read until here, I don't
want to disappointing you, I would like to say to you that I do space
travels, kung fu, rock band, volunteer work or maintaning some open source project. But I'm sorry, I'm just a typical geek, I love to play video games, tabletop RPG and boardgames. Of course I also do love watch movies, series, animations, why not read books and HQs and listen heavy metal bands. Whaaat? Do you like of these stuff too?
Awesome!!!!! I hope we can hangout soon! :)
