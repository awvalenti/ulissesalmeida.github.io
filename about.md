about me... but wait, what do you want to know? It's a blog about coding then
you may imagine that I'm software developer. You're right, my job title is "Software Developer". Why? Because most of my tasks in my job at [Plataformatec][plataformatec] is write and review a lot of Ruby code. My teammates don't call me by the job title, "Hey software developer, come here pls", they call my attention using my name. My name is Ulisses, nice to meet you! :smile:

"LoL I think you have typo in your name, shouldn't you write Ulysses?". No way! I'm from Brazil, we use "i" around here.

In my free time I do stuff that geeks do. I love to play video games, tabletop RPG and boardgames, watch movies, series, animations, read books and HQs. My resolution for 2016 is learn how to swim! I started the swim lessons in the beginning of January and until now is being awesome!

Thank you for your patience until here. I hope we can hangout soon! :)
